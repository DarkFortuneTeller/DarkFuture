# Illegal Items

#

# Adds the "Illegal Item Tooltip Background" added with Phantom Liberty to several items
# from the base game that are fictionally illegal, as well as several "black market" items
# from Phantom Liberty. Does not change item behavior. Black Lace is also handled in
# a separate .yaml file.
